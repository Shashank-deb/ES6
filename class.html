<!-- Javascript classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015 , are primarily syntactical sugar over 
Javascript's existing prototype-based inheritabnce


A class is a type of function , but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it, we use the 
keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside  a constructor() method .



A class is user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.It 
represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one 
type. -->

  // function students(){

  class Students {
    constructor(name, age, branch) {
      this.myname = name;
      this.myage = age;
      this.mybranch = branch;
    }

    // instance method of the Students class
    biodata() {
   
      return  `Hi Iam class method ${this.myname} my age is : ${this.myage} and mybranch is : ${this.mybranch}`
